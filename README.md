# ResearchMethodologyProject
A tracking-guided SegFormer pipeline for rapid, microscopy-based phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (pDST). This includes transformer-based binary segmentation of time-lapse microscopy (REF vs RIF), pseudo-tracking refinement to improve temporal consistency, and compute area curves, rolling exponential growth rates, and early-detection markers.
